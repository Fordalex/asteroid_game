# Fds Games

This is a library of all my game projects, please take a look and see if you can set any new high scores.

## UX

I'm trying to use loads of icons to guide the user through this web app as I'm assuming the type of user that will be using this site will be of the younger generation.

## Things to do

- Add travisCI.
- Create a home page where more games can be created.
- Add mastermind project so high scores can be saved.

## bugs

I need to use AJAX to submit the form so I can stop the user being able to change their score before submittion.

### Asteroid

bullets will shoot when the game is pause.
Need to stop the player from being able to leave the play area.
If the user edits the form before it's sent they can changed their score.

## Features to implement

### Asteroid

- Add a minigun to the player when it's activated.
- Let the player purchase more powerful jets to move the player quicker.
- Add sounds to each section of the game.
- More feedback to the user after an item is purchased.

### Mastermind

This project was taken from one of my older projects. [Mastermind](https://github.com/Fordalex/mastermind-project)

I will be refractoring this code becasue the html can easily be done using js.

Add scoreboard and database to this project.

### Mulitplayer Pong

My next project will be multiplayer pong, using sockets.io.

I've been watching this video and I'm taking the code step by step to get a understanding of how an object is coliding with a line. I'll then be refractoring this coding and using P5.js to create my own vision.
