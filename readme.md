# Asteroid Game

[Play Game](https://fd-games.herokuapp.com/)

## UX

I'm trying to use loads of icons to guide the user through this web app as I'm assuming the type of user that will be using this site will be of the younger generation.

## Things to do

- Add travisCI.
- Create a home page where more games can be created.
- Add mastermind project so high scores can be saved.

## bugs

### Asteroid

bullets will shoot when the game is pause.
Need to stop the player from being able to leave the play area.
If the user edits the form before it's sent they can changed their score.

## Features to implement

### Asteroid

- Add a minigun to the player when it's activated.
- Add a flame for when the player moves around.
- Let the player purchase more powerful jets to move the player quicker.

### Mastermind

Add scoreboard and database to this project.
