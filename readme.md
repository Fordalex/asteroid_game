# Asteroid Game

[Play Game](https://fordalex.github.io/asteroid_game/)

## bugs

need to remove the bullets when they go outside the canvas area.
Need to stop the enemies from traveling past the player.
15 should be max bullet speed.


## Features to implement

I'm going to change this into a flask app so that high scores can be saved.
Create the debri from small trangles.
